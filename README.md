## DSA Code & Algorithm

<br />

1. CountDown : This program will help you to get break at specific interval;

2. KthSmallest : This program helps us to find Kth smallest element;

3. Max_Min : This Program show the smallest and greatest element in array;

4. Sieve_of_Eratosthenes : This Program will print all the prime numbers but with better Time complexity;

5. Discounted price : This program show the discounted price of each product;

6. Ticket Office : This program show the price of Ticket after maximum discout for group of 5 people;

7. Key_Search : This program will search for specified key in array;

8. Tower_of_Hanoi : We have 3 block in 1st rod and other 2 rod are empty move all the blocks in rod 3 such that bigger block always 
                    stays in bottom;

9. ###########--LINKLIST--###########

(i).   First program of linklist consist of code that give us output - normal linklist after calling fucntion;

(ii).  In next program i have used both normal and recursive function to reverse linklist;

(iii). Third program consist of fucntion to make cycle linklist, detectection of cycle linklist and then finally 
         how we remove a cycle linklist;

(iv). Doubly linklist- program to build doubly linklist, how to delete in doublylist and how insert in

    are programmed in details;

(v). program to append K nodes in linklist;

(vi). Program to verify two linklist is intersecting or not ;

(vii). program to merge the sorted linklist.
