## DSA Code & Algorithm

<br />

1. CountDown : This program will help you to get break at specific interval.

2. KthSmallest : This program helps us to find Kth smallest element.

3. Max_Min : This Program show the smallest and greatest element in array.

4. Sieve_of_Eratosthenes : This Program will print all the prime numbers but with better Time complexity.
